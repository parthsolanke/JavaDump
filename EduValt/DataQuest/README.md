Absolutely! Below is a **detailed documentation-style file** you can use alongside your project. It includes the **context**, **objectives**, and **descriptions of all tasks**, organized by difficulty. This is structured like a proper internal lab specification or **developer onboarding doc** you might find in a real-world Java engineering team.

# ðŸ“„ **Java Streams Mastery Lab â€“ Specification Document**

## ðŸ“˜ Project Title:

**DataQuest Labs â€“ Stream Odyssey**

---

## ðŸ§© Objective:

This lab is designed to help you **master Java Streams, functional-style programming**, and gain practical experience with **stream-based transformations, aggregation, sorting, grouping, filtering, and mapping** operations in Java. You'll work with various **data types** (numbers, strings, collections, nested collections, and POJOs) and explore the **full range of Stream API capabilities**.

The lab also introduces **Comparator/Comparable**, `Optional`, grouping with `Collectors`, and basic functional patterns.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java              # Main runner file for trying your solutions
â”œâ”€â”€ DataStore.java         # Prepopulated data store (no need to create test data)
â”œâ”€â”€ model/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Student.java       # Student(name, score)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Person.java        # Person(name, age, city)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Employee.java      # Employee(name, department, salary)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Task.java          # Task(id, dependencies)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started:

* Use `DataStore` to get pre-filled data for each task.
* Write all your Stream operations in `Main.java` or in your own helper class.
* No loops allowed. Use **pure Java Stream API only**.
* You are not expected to write tests, UIs, or advanced class designs. Just focus on **stream-based logic**.

## ðŸ”´ **Advanced Tasks**

### 11. Flatten & Distinct

**Goal**: Flatten a list of lists of integers and return a distinct sorted list.
**Data**: `DataStore.getNestedNumbers()`
**Output**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

---

### 12. Word Frequency Map

**Goal**: Return `Map<String, Long>` with word count.
**Input**: List of words

---

### 13. Multi-Level Sorting (Person)

**Goal**: Sort people by city (asc), age (desc), name (asc).
**Data**: `DataStore.getPeople()`
**Use**: `Comparator.comparing(...)`

---

### 14. Merge Score Maps

**Goal**: Merge quiz and assignment maps to produce total scores.
**Data**:

* `DataStore.getQuizScores()`
* `DataStore.getAssignmentScores()`

---

### 15. Max By Group

**Goal**: Find the highest-paid employee in each department.
**Data**: `DataStore.getEmployees()`
**Output**: `Map<String, Optional<Employee>>`

---

## ðŸŸ£ **Expert Tasks**

### 16. Anagram Grouping

## ðŸ”§ Helper Tips

* Use `Collectors.groupingBy`, `Collectors.mapping`, `Collectors.toMap`, `Comparator`, `flatMap`, `distinct()`, `sorted()`, `limit()`, `skip()`, etc.
* For optional fields or nulls, use `Optional`, `Comparator.nullsLast(...)`
* All data is ready. Just **import**, **stream**, and **solve**.
