# ðŸ“„ Requirement Document: Student Activity Tracker

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

A university conducts a co-curricular program where students actively participate in various events. To measure student engagement and improve program effectiveness, the university wants to track participation, feedback, and event trends across students.

---

## ðŸ§­ Context

Each student provides the following data:

* **Name**: `String`
* **Events Attended**: `String` â€” a comma-separated list of event names (e.g., `"Coding, Dance, Debate"`)
* **Feedback Ratings**: `int[]` â€” one rating per event
* **Activity Log**: `LinkedList<String>` â€” entries in the format `"HH:mm|EventName"` indicating participation with a timestamp

The university aims to analyze this data to derive insights about:

* Student-level involvement
* Event popularity
* Feedback quality

---

## âœ… Functional Requirements

### **Requirement 1: Parse Events List**

* **Objective**: Extract the list of individual event names from the student's comma-separated event string.
* **Input**: `"Coding, Dance, Debate"`
* **Output**: `["Coding", "Dance", "Debate"]`
* **Implementation Rule**: Use `String` manipulation only (no external libraries).

---

### **Requirement 2: Calculate Average Feedback Score**

* **Objective**: Compute the average feedback rating per student from their given `int[]` of scores.
* **Input**: `[80, 90, 83]`
* **Output**: `84.33`
* **Implementation Rule**: Use **Java Streams** for calculation.

---

### **Requirement 3: Identify Unique Events Across All Students**

* **Objective**: Get a single sorted list of **distinct event names** from all student records.
* **Input**: Event lists from all students
* **Output**: `["Coding", "Dance", "Debate", "Drama", "Music", "Quiz"]`
* **Implementation Rule**: Use **Streams** for flattening, deduplication, and sorting.

---

### **Requirement 4: Generate Participation Timeline per Student**

* **Objective**: Sort the participation logs by time and reformat them per student.
* **Input**: `["10:00|Coding", "11:30|Dance", "14:00|Debate"]` for Alice
* **Output**:

  ```
  Alice - 10:00 - Coding  
  Alice - 11:30 - Dance  
  Alice - 14:00 - Debate  
  ```
* **Implementation Rule**: Use **LinkedList traversal** and **Streams** for sorting and formatting.

---

### **Requirement 5: Determine Most Common Event (Overall)**

* **Objective**: Identify the event that occurs most frequently across all students.
* **Input**: All student event lists
* **Output**: `"Coding"` (if it's the most frequent)
* **Implementation Rule**: Use **Streams** + `Collections.frequency()` or a `Map<String, Integer>` for counting.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Input Constraints

To ensure valid analytics:

* **Minimum Students**: 5
* **Per Student**:

  * â‰¥ 3 events
  * â‰¥ 3 feedback scores
  * â‰¥ 3 participation log entries
